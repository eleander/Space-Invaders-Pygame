A recreation of Space Invaders in Python using Pygame for the intention to learn and understand the Pygame library.

Tutorial to learn PyGame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
The above video was used in order to understand the semantics of Pygame and the basics of creating a game.
Items learnt include: game loops, player movement, enemy movement, collisions and showing images/sound
Changes were made to to the code used in the above video in order to improve frame rate
and objects were created for player, bullet and enemy.
